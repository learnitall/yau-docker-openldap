# Yet Another Unofficial OpenLDAP Docker Image

There are a lot of different ways to run and administer OpenLDAP, and
doing so through Docker doesn't seem to be the most popular option out there.
But hey, whether you're running in a development environment or in production,
this image was designed with the following principles in mind:

* **Easy of Use**: Should be able to go from zero to 100 with relatively small
  amounts of reading and typing. This image adheres to the best practices layed
  out in the [OpenLDAP administration guide](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/).
* **No Middle-Man**: Using the image to deploy OpenLDAP shouldn't get in the
  way of using and configuring OpenLDAP.
* **Flexibility**: Almost everything in this image should be capable of being tailored
  towards your deployment needs.
